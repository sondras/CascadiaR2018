#  What Can We Do as Researchers and Data Scientists? 

+ ***Collaborate*** to gain domain knowledge in area of analysis to ensure accuracy of findings and decrease harm to potentially sensitive groups that may be under-represented
+ ***Utilize mixed methods*** **** with large scale data to improve accuracy of findings and ensure underrepresented groups have voice
+ Engage in ***Training*** **** in data ethics

#  What Can We Do as Researchers and Data Scientists?  

+ ***Promote policies*** for data ethics that include considerations and biases related to vulnerable and underrepresented populations
+ Advocate for a ***balance of data access and data privacy*** ** to ensure protection while also avoiding exposing more subject groups and vulnerable populations
+ Continue to ***encourage diversity*** in the field of data science and research

#  What Can We Do as Researchers and Data Scientists? 


**Take Time to Reflect!**
+ Who is missing?
+ What are the potential biases?
+ What are the potential impacts of assumptions and findings?
+ Who should I be collaborating with to ensure the domain knowledge to answer the prior questions?
+ How could this be misinterpreted? How do I help to communicate and advocate for appropriate use?

#  Whatâ€™s Next?? 

+ Develop ***ethical standards*** for reporting of big data use in research (e.g. consistent reporting of data linkage rates)
+ Need for ***ethical guidelines*** in the field of data science â€“ contribute your expertise!
+ Include data ethics in training for data scientists ***with particular attention to special populations***
